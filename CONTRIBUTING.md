# Pull Requests

- Keep your PRs nice and small around 300 changes. PRs that are way over that threshold won't be merged.
  - If 300 changes is not enough,
    - make as many changes as you can according to the PR size limitation,
    - make sure that the code is compilable and the application is usable,
    - create TODOs right in the code for the unfinished work,
    - submit PR with the unfinished work and TODOs,
    - TODOs will be converted to separate issues
